A simple GUI program to translate to/from pig latin from/to english

The rules of pig latin (from wikipedia):

The usual rules for changing standard English into Pig Latin are as follows:
For words that begin with consonant sounds, the initial consonant or consonant cluster is moved to the end of the word, and "ay" is added, as in the following examples:
    "happy" → "appyhay"
    "duck" → "uckday"
    "glove" → "oveglay"
For words that begin with vowel sounds or silent letter, "way" is added at the end of the word. Examples are
    "egg" → "eggway"
    "inbox" → "inboxway"
    "eight" → "eightway"
In some variants, though, just add an "ay" at the end.
   "egg" → "eggay"
Yet another acceptable variant is to add the ending "yay" to words that begin with a vowel sound.
    "egg" → "eggyay"
