########Issues and features to fix/add:############
1. fix GUI window sizing on mac. Make sure GUI sizing does not cut off window between system

2. Fix all code indentation! The indentation in most all the files is super inconsistent and confusing, make it look hella fine.

3. Add component to keep track of recent translations. 

4. Add another section of the window which would keep track of recent translations, including both the input text and the translated text. Bonus points for writing it to a file so that one can view the history if they were to close and reopen the program.

5. Add more fonts

6. Add a button which switches the direction of translation. As the code stands now, if someone is translating from say English to Pig Latin wants to translate Pig Latin to English instead, they must select the option from the drop down menu. Add a button that would switch the translate direction with one click, similar to Google Translate.

7. Add buttons on the help/instruction pop up windows to close them instead of using the default x in the corner of the window. Make it look more like the rest of the interface.

8. Add sound effects. Ideas: Some kind of click sound for opening/closing windows or selecting options from the drop down menu.
Error sound if press return and the field contains no text.
Perhaps a confirm sound when pig latin is translated to english and no words need to be selected from the drop down menus, and a different sound if not.

9. Add a new Language!
