The README.md is incorrect. The ant -p does not display an 'ant run' option, but rather an 'ant Gibberish' and and 'ant PigLatin'. The code runs well, but has some small mistakes like 'my' going to 'myay' and 'upidstay' going to 'tupids' in the reverse translator. The Gibberish translator only adds the string 'uvug' to the word in random places, making it not real gibberish. There is some code that can be is being repeated in both the gibberish and piglatin files (the isVowel() method). Also, the junit tests do not check for some minor test cases like short words or words ending in certain special letters, like 'y'.
